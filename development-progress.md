# Email Validator Development Progress

## Current Focus: Priority 1 - Core Validation Pipeline
### 1.1 Email Syntax Validation

We are starting with implementing the core email validation functionality following RFC 5322 standards. 
The implementation will be done in stages:

1. RFC 5322 compliant validator
2. Internationalized email address support
3. Local and domain part validation
4. Edge cases and special character handling

Progress tracking will be maintained in this document as we implement each component.

## Implementation Progress
