# Performance Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document details the performance improvements implemented in the system, including DNS caching,
connection pooling, and batch processing optimizations.

## 1. DNS Cache Optimization
The DNS caching system has been optimized with the following features:
- Sharded cache implementation to reduce lock contention
- Per-shard locking for improved concurrency
- Efficient bulk operations support
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Concurrent cleanup of expired entries

### Key Benefits:
- Reduced lock contention
- Improved cache hit rates
- Better scalability under high load
- Lower memory usage through efficient storage

## 2. Connection Pool Enhancement
The SMTP connection pool has been enhanced with:
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Connection lifecycle tracking
- Pool utilization monitoring
- Performance metrics gathering
- Efficient connection reuse

### Metrics Tracked:
- Connection acquisition times
- Pool utilization rates
- Connection errors and timeouts
- Server distribution statistics

## 3. Batch Processing
Batch processing has been optimized through:
- Intelligent grouping of operations
- Reduced lock contention
- Efficient bulk cache operations
- Performance monitoring

### Implementation Details:
- Groups related operations to minimize lock acquisitions
- Uses sharding for better concurrency
- Implements efficient bulk operations
- Tracks batch operation performance

## 4. Monitoring System
A comprehensive monitoring system has been implemented:
- Real-time performance metrics
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Connection pool statistics
- Resource utilization tracking

### Available Metrics:
- DNS cache performance
- Connection pool utilization
- Batch operation efficiency
- Memory usage statistics

## Usage
To access performance metrics:
```python
# Get DNS cache metrics
metrics = await cache_monitor.get_metrics()
dns_stats = metrics.get("dns", {})

# Get connection pool metrics
pool_metrics = connection_pool._metrics.get_metrics()
```

## Configuration
Key configuration options:
```python
DNSCache(
    default_ttl=300,  # Cache TTL in seconds
    num_shards=16     # Number of cache shards
)

SMTPConnectionPool(
    max_connections=10,
    connection_timeout=30,
    max_lifetime=3600
)
```
