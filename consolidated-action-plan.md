## Remaining High-Priority Tasks

### 1. Performance Optimization
- [x] Implement SMTP connection pooling
  - Added connection pooling with enhanced features:
    - Connection reuse and proper cleanup
    - Connection lifetime management
    - Exponential backoff for connection retries
    - Connection health checks
    - Prometheus metrics for monitoring
    - Proper timeout handling
- [ ] Optimize DNS resolution performance
- [ ] Add connection timeout handling

## Next Steps
- Moving on to implement DNS resolution performance optimizations
- Will focus on caching and parallel resolution strategies
