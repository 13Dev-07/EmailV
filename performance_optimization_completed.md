# Performance Optimization Completed

The following optimizations have been implemented:

1. DNS Caching Mechanism:
   - Implemented sharded cache with multiple locks to reduce contention
   - Added metrics collection for cache performance
   - Implemented concurrent cleanup of expired entries
   - Added support for bulk operations with shard-aware batching

2. Batch Processing:
   - Implemented batch-aware DNS cache operations
   - Added metrics for batch operation performance
   - Optimized lock usage in batch operations

3. Connection Pooling Metrics:
   - Added comprehensive metrics collection for SMTP connection pool
   - Implemented connection lifecycle tracking
   - Added pool utilization and performance metrics
   - Integrated with monitoring system

4. Memory Usage Optimization:
   - Implemented efficient shard-based storage
   - Added memory usage tracking in metrics
   - Optimized data structures for cache entries
   - Implemented concurrent cleanup of expired entries

All components are now properly instrumented with metrics collection and monitoring capabilities,
allowing for performance tracking and optimization.
